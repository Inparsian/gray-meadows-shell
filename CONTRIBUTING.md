## Reporting Issues

If you encounter a bug or have a feature request, please make sure that nobody else has already reported it before opening a new issue.

When reporting an issue, please include:
- A clear and descriptive title
- A detailed description of the problem or feature request
- Steps to reproduce the issue (if applicable)
- Any relevant screenshots or logs

Features that I don't personally plan to implement will be considered on the condition that it is made optional for users.

## Submitting Code Contributions

If you'd like to contribute code (bug/performance fixes, new features, etc.), all I ask is that you:

- Try to follow the existing coding style as closely as possible
- Include comments where necessary to explain complex logic
- Test your changes thoroughly before submitting a pull request
- Open multiple PRs if you have many unrelated changes
