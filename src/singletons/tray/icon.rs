// Rationale: Some icons have the possibility of being absurdly large (e.g. 1024x1024). This may not seem like an
// issue at first, however, compared to a measly 32x32 icon, which has a total of 4096 (32^2*4) ARGB values, a
// 1024x1024 icon has a total of 4,194,304 (1024^2*4) ARGB values.
//
// That is a LOT of data to store in memory AND convert to a Pixbuf. Not only does this lead to huge performance
// issues, but the detail in icons that large are imperceptible when they're resized to a smaller size, so this also
// leads to unnecessary memory usage.
